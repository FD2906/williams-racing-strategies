Q4 / KPI 4 - Driver Lap Time Consistency Index

Question 4: "How does the standard deviation of lap times for each Williams driver during a race 
            compare to their teammate across a season, and what interventions can improve consistency?"

KPI 4: Driver Lap Time Consistency Index - Lap time standard deviation per driver, per race.

Hypothesis 4: Rookie or less experienced Williams drivers had significantly higher lap time variance than 
            their teammates during races in the 2015-2019 seasons, suggesting lower in-race consistency 
            due to inexperience or adaptability challenges.

Steps:
1. Write a general function grouping drivers by df['rookie_or_experienced'], and the std dev of df['lap_time_ms']
2. Add a column to each converting lap_time_ms to mm:ss:ms
3. Compare the two dataframes with each other.

Next steps, in stage 4 - visualisation, with filters, and hypothesis testing using ttest_ind() and similar methods.
